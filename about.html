          We are a group of people with decades of experience in growing and
          selling apples. We know what a good apple looks like and how they
          are grown. This essential fruit requires a temperate climate, loamy
          soil that is rich in organic matter apart from needing proper
          drainage and aeration facilities. Lucky for us we live in Kashmir
          which is proudly known as paradise of earth is also home to
          temperate fruits like apple for which the state is very famous
          across globe. The main factor which influence temperate fruit
          bearing trees is soil, climate and environment which are highly
          favorable and unparalleled in the province of Kashmir. Kashmiri
          apples a unique look, taste, flavor, size and color.
